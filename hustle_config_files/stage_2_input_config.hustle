input_run       'exotic_uvis_run_1'                         # Str. This is the name of the Stage 1 run you want to load.
output_run      'exotic_uvis_run_1'                         # Str. This is the name to save the current run to. It can be anything that does not contain spaces or special characters (e.g. $, %, @, etc.).
verbose         2                                           # Int from 0 to 2. 0 = print nothing. 1 = print some statements. 2 = print every action.
show_plots      2                                           # Int from 0 to 2. 0 = show nothing. 1 = show some plots. 2 = show all plots.

# Step 1: Read in the data

# Step 2: Trace configuration
path_to_cal     './'                                        # Str. The absolute path to the .conf file used by GRISMCONF for the chip your data were taken on.
traces_to_conf  ('+1','-1')                                 # Lst of str. The traces you want to configure and extraction from.
refine_fit      True                                        # Bool. If True, uses Gaussian fitting to refine the trace solution.

# Step 3: 1D spectral extraction
method          'box'                                       # Str. Options are 'box' (draw a box around the trace and sum without weights) or 'optimal' (weight using Horne 1986 methods).
correct_zero    False                                       # Bool. Whether to model the contaminating 0th order and subtract it from your data during extraction. Sometimes works, sometimes just adds lots of scatter.
subtract_contam False                                       # Bool. Whether to model the contaminating orders and subtract them from your trace during extraction. Sometimes works, sometimes just adds lots of scatter.
sens_correction False                                       # Bool. Whether to correct for the G280's changing sensitivity as a function of wavelength. Since absolute calibrated spectra aren't needed in exoplanetary sciences, you can skip this safely.
mask_objs       [[0,0,0],]                                  # List of lists. If there are background objects in your planned aperture, mask them here. Each entry is (x,y,radius).

# Step 3a: Box extraction parameters
determine_hw    True                                        # Bool. If True, automatically determines preferred half-width for each order by minimizing out-of-transit/eclipse residuals.
indices         ([0,10],[-10,-1])                           # Lst of lsts of int. If determine_hw, these are the indices used to estimate the out-of-transit/eclipse residuals.
halfwidths_box  (12,12)                                     # Lst of ints. The half-width of extraction aperture to use for each order. Input here is ignored if 'determine_hw' is True.

# Step 3b: Optimum extraction parameters
aperture_type   'median'                                    # Str. Type of aperture to draw. Options are 'median', 'polyfit', 'smooth', or 'curved_poly'.
halfwidths_opt  (12,12)                                     # Lst of ints. The half-width of extraction aperture to use for each order. For optimum extraction, you should make this big (>12 pixels at least). There is no 'preferred' half-width in optimum extraction due to the weights.

# Step 4: 1D spectral cleaning and aligning
outlier_sigma   3.5                                         # Float. Sigma at which to reject spectral outliers in time. Outliers are replaced with median of timeseries. Enter False to skip this step.
align           True                                        # Bool. If True, uses cross-correlation to align spectra to keep wavelength solution consistent.
