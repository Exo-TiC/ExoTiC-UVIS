    "ExoTiC-UVIS operates using configuration files, designated with the .hustle file extension. Each .hustle file controls one Stage of ExoTiC-UVIS. .hustle files are more human-readable than raw code and they allow you to easily reproduce previous runs of ExoTiC-UVIS as well as rapidly share your reduction and analysis methods with your colleagues.\n",

    "Now we need to make our Stage 2 .hustle file. The next cell contains a template stage_2.hustle file which you can modify to run Stage 2 of ExoTiC-UVIS. We're going to modify it so that it calibrates and extracts from the HUSTLE program observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-127b that we downloaded in Stage 0 and reduced in Stage 1. To make it do this, make the following changes to the .hustle file template:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set input_run to the string 'reduction_1' so we can use our reduced files from the last Stage.\n",
    "2. Set output_run to the string 'extraction_1' to keep our different extraction attempts separated.\n",
    "3. Set the verbose, show_plots, and save_plots variables to each be 0, 1, or 2. verbose controls how many printed statements the pipeline produces, letting you keep track of what the pipeline is doing and what step it is on. show_plots allows the pipeline to temporarily pause execution to show you an interactive plot. save_plots saves output .png or .gif files for plots and other graphics produced. 0 prints/shows/saves nothing, while 2 prints/shows/saves everything.\n",
    "4. Set path_to_cal to the absolute path of UVIS_G280_CCD2_V2.conf on your computer so that GRISMCONF knows where to find the files needed to calibrate the traces.\n",
    "5. Set traces_to_conf to ('+1','-1'). This tells ExoTiC-UVIS that we want to extract the +1st and -1st orders.\n",
    "6. We will be using the 'box' method of extraction, which extracts the data using an unweighted aperture. Set halfwidths_box to (12,12). This tells ExoTiC-UVIS to use an aperture halfwidth of 12 pixels for both orders.\n",
    "7. Set outlier_sigma to 5.0 and align to True. This tells the pipeline to reject spectral outliers at 5.0-sigma, and to use cross-correlation to correct any displacements that may have happened during the observation.\n",
