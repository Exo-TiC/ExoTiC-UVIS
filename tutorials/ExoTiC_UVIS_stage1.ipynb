    "ExoTiC-UVIS operates using configuration files, designated with the .hustle file extension. Each .hustle file controls one Stage of ExoTiC-UVIS. .hustle files are more human-readable that raw code and they allow you to easily reproduce previous runs of ExoTiC-UVIS as well as rapidly sharing your reduction and analysis methods with your colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to make our Stage 1 .hustle file. The next cell contains a template stage_1.hustle file which you can modify to run Stage 1 of ExoTiC-UVIS. We're going to modify it so that it reduces the HUSTLE program observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-127b that we downloaded in Stage 0. To make it do this, make the following changes to the .hustle file template:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set run_name to the string 'reduction_1'.\n",
    "2. Set the verbose, show_plots, and save_plots variables to each be 0, 1, or 2. verbose controls how many printed statements the pipeline produces, letting you keep track of what the pipeline is doing and what step it is on. show_plots allows the pipeline to temporarily pause execution to show you an interactive plot. save_plots saves output .png or .gif files for plots and other graphics produced. 0 prints/shows/saves nothing, while 2 prints/shows/saves everything.\n",
    "3. Set do_free_iter to True and free_sigma to 4.5. This tells ExoTiC-UVIS to iterate over each pixel's time series and replace outliers at the 4.5-sigma level until no more outliers are found.\n",
    "4. Set do_uniform to True, fit to 'Gaussian', and hist_bins to 10000. This tells ExoTiC-UVIS to fit a single background value to each frame using the regions of the detector specified by the bounds variable.\n",
    "5. Set do_location and do_0thtracking to True. Both of these methods refine the position of the direct image source location as well as the source's location in the spectroscopic images (known as the 0th order).\n",

Practically every pixel was flagged as a cosmic ray at least once! That's definitely too much cleaning. The quicklookupDQ.gif file also shows the traces clearly appearing in some frames, meaning that large parts of real signal were flagged as outliers and replaced. That's not good! Make sure to make good use of these diagnostic plots to ensure your reduction is removing noise and not signal!\n",
